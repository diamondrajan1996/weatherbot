# WeBo_WeatherBot
A ChatBot that allows user to have rudimentary conversations, and ask about weather conditions in various parts of the world. The code uses RASA NLU and RASA Core libraries for setting up the bot, and retrieves weather information from Yahoo APIs.

All the employed pipelines can be found in the config.yml file.

Work still in progress....
